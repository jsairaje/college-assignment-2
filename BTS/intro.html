            <h1>SUGA</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Name</strong>:Min Yoon-gi <br>
                 born on March 9, 1993, in Daegu, 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul.<br>
                 He is the lead rapper of BTS.<br>

                He became interested in rapping after listening to Stony Skunk’s “Reggae Muffin,” 
                and decided to become a rapper after listening to Epik High’s “Fly.”<br>
                Prior to joining Big Hit Entertainment, Suga used to be an underground rapper with the stage name Gloss.<br>

                In 2010, when he was part of the hip-hop crew D-Town, he produced the song “518-062” in commemoration of the Gwangju Uprising.<br>

                He originally joined Big Hit as a producer, not an idol.<br>

                When forming BTS, Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk told Suga that he didn’t have to dance 
                and all he had to do was rap. Suga later joked that he was “deceived” by Bang.<br>
                Although he did various part-time jobs while studying music in Daegu, it was hard for him to afford 
                expenses for food and transportation. When he was in high school, 
                he earned pocket money by arranging a school song.<br>
                In his self-made song “140505 at Dawn,” Suga reveals that he had suffered from mental problems, such as social phobia, depression and obsession.<br>
                Suga has a habit of biting his nails.<br>
                According to J-Hope, he is one of the most caring members in BTS.Suga may not look very affectionate at first, as he is quite taciturn and doesn’t smile much.<br>
